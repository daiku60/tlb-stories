After some experiences in different startups and mobile-focused companies in Barcelona, these three random guys met working together at Wallapop. There they began to discuss pretty much anything; but above all, they shared their love for food, üç∫, and software.

In the next step of their careers, they started working as freelancers. Eventually, they realized the value was in having a one-stop shop for all their client‚Äôs software needs

The time passed and now they have created the opportunity to do what they love (eat, code and drink) for a living
